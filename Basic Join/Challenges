/* Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in 
descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of 
challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result. */
/* The difficulty in this question is that the last sentense. We need to get the max number of challenge AND the same total number of challenges solved by more than 
one student. Thus, we need to write two sub-quiry to return the results and put them into conditional clauses in the outer query, like HAVING/ WHERE. */
